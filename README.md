# tableau_citibike

Created a story and dashboards in Tableau using Citibike data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data In order to analyze the data in Tableau, I concatenated all the csv files into one file using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. I then exported that concatenated dataframe as csv to upload into Tableau. 

Tableau TWBX file is the finished product.
